# IOTBAU

-UNDER CONSTRUCTION-

This includes the work for the project SEEDIOT for BAU
SEEDIOT is the project which includes 2 nodes and 1 main station. Nodes are operated by Arduino Nano and main station is operated by Arduino Uno.

Every node has 1K Thermistor and humidity sensor and sens data with Bluetooh to main station.
Main station captures datas from nodes and sends it to the ThingSpeak via ESP8266.

And after that with the API keys that served by ThingSpeak, I can able to watch datas from Android Application.
